# Java Bank Project

This is a personal project I developed to practice my Java skills. It's a command-line banking system where I focused on applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) logic and handling user inputs effectively.

## Why I built this

I wanted to move beyond basic syntax and understand how to structure a real-world logic (like deposits, withdrawals, and balance management) using classes and clean code.
